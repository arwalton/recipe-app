It’s just as sweet, savory, tangy, and delicious—but it features crispy, pan-seared pieces of chicken instead of ground beef. The chicken is finished in the same signature sesame-and-soy-spiked concoction known as bulgogi sauce (cue the swoons). There’s also quick-pickled cucumber ribbons, tender shredded carrots, and a spicy sriracha crema all arranged over a bed of fluffy white rice. Dig in!",

We especially love fresh arugula as a topping on these flatbreads; its peppery bite is a great match for all the other ingredients like sweet red pepper spread, melty mozz, and garlic-marinated tomato. The balsamic glaze drizzled on top adds a tangy sweetness that’s just chef’s kiss. Those Romans must’ve been onto something because we’re definitely feeling lucky to have this for dinner!",

It’s actually because the fried egg on top resembles a lady’s wide-brimmed hat (lightbulb moment!). Traditionally, these hot sandwiches are made with ham, Gruyère, and bechamel on slices of French white bread. Here, our chefs add a decidedly global spin, baking prosciutto, gouda, and Parmesan with a Dijon cream sauce on sourdough until the bread is crisp and the cheese is bubbling. With the added bonus of a fried egg, it's an indelible comfort—perfect for a cozy lunch or brunch.",

This recipe, however, although undeniably Mediterranean in flavor, is anything but laid back. In fact, it will be in and out of your kitchen in barely any time at all—you can make it in as little as 20 minutes. All it takes is a few zaps in the microwave to warm up the stock for the couscous, followed by a little chopping for the salad and a quick sautée for the chicken.",

Our chefs came up with the perfect filling for fresh and crisp romaine leaves by piling them with sautéed turkey and bell pepper in a chili-soy sauce, candied peanuts, and a garnish of cilantro. Get ready to be wowed by the wrap.",

Then there are the cozy, cold-weather toppings, like pears cooked with warming spices and luxurious crème fraîche mixed with maple syrup. Perfect for breakfast, brunch, or dessert, this baby is so easy to make you’ll want to go Dutch all the time.",

The sweet scallops served on top are seared and butter-basted so they’re extra luscious. Is it getting hot in here? No, just us?",

It’s all piled over cilantro-lime rice with tomato, pickled onion, and tangy lime crema. Now, who really needs the meat when you’ve got all that?",
